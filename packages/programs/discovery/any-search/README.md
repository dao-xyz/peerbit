# AnySearch

This module contains a communication protocol for a generic search that can be used across a wide range of data types. The purpose of this module is to allow peers to query and data like "pictures of cat" even if they don't know where to look for the cats (i.e. in what programs and networks)


🚧 Documentation is WIP 🚧

As of now you can learn how to use this module by reading how the [Document store module](./../../data//document) incorporates search capabilities.

# Peerbit.org site update

*January 23, 2026*

We’ve updated the peerbit.org site with a refreshed docs experience and a better foundation for publishing updates.

## What’s new

- Syntax highlighting for code blocks in docs.
- `:include` snippets now resolve correctly when a route falls back to a folder `README.md`.
- Blog now has a dedicated **Posts** section (for updates) and an **Articles** section (longer reads).

## Run it locally

```sh
pnpm run site:dev
```

## What’s next

- Add more posts and improve the blog index (tags, dates, and summaries).
- Polish doc pages (more examples, better navigation, and improved content structure).

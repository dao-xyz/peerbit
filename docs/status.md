# Network status

This page is meant to give a quick overview of:

- Public bootstrap node health
- Peerbit network connectivity indicators (later)

## Bootstrap health

Bootstrap checks are not configured yet. This page will start showing health data once a
status generator publishes `status/bootstrap.json`.

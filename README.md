## A building block for the decentralized web

Peerbit is as easy-to-use as Firebase and provide P2P functionality like OrbitDB or GunJS yet with performance for data-intensive applications like live-streaming and cloud-gaming. It’s built on top of Libp2p (and works with IPFS) supporting encryption, sharding and discoverability (searching).

Your database schema can remain very simple but still utilize P2P networks, auto-scaling, E2E-encryption, discoverability and all other features you’d expect from a database.

## Optimized for performance

Peerbit is performant, so performant in fact you can use it for [streaming video](https://stream.dao.xyz) by having peers subscribing to database updates. In a low latency setting, you can achieve around 1000 replications a second and have a thoughput of 100 MB/s.

## Get Started

1. Install Peerbit by following the simple setup instructions in our [Installation Guide](https://peerbit.org/#/getting-started).

2. Dive into our comprehensive [Documentation](https://peerbit.org/#/modules/client/) or checkout the [Example repository](https://github.com/dao-xyz/peerbit-examples) to explore the powerful features and learn how to leverage Peerbit to its fullest potential.

3. Join us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#peerbit:matrix.org) to connect, share ideas, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

## Contribute

Peerbit is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from developers like you! Feel free to contribute code, report issues, and submit feature requests. Together, let's shape the future of Peerbit.

IMPORTANT: Peerbit uses pnpm.

1. Check pnpm version: `pnpm -v` should print something
2. Install: `pnpm install`
3. Build: `pnpm run build`
4. Run tests: `pnpm run test` in root or in a specific subpackage

You might possibly need to CMD + Shift + P and then enter to restart the typescript server after the build step.

To create a new package, follow the following steps:

1. Clone the time folder within /packages/utils/time to the desired destination and rename it
2. Update the package.json `name`, `description`, `version` fields
3. Possibly add other depencencies to the package.json `dependencies` field (like `@peerbit/crypto`)
4. Delete contents in CHANGELOG.md
5. Update the root package.json `workspaces` field
6. Update the root pnpm-workspace.yaml packages list
7. Run `pnpm install` once in the root

We recommend running tests with the VS Code integration though: https://github.com/CoderLine/mocha-vscode

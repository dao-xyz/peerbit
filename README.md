## A building block for the decentralized web

Peerbit is as easy-to-use as Firebase and provide P2P functionality like OrbitDB or GunJS yet with performance for data-intensive applications like live-streaming and cloud-gaming. It’s built on top of Libp2p (and works with IPFS) supporting encryption, sharding and discoverability (searching).

Your database schema can remain very simple but still utilize P2P networks, auto-scaling, E2E-encryption, discoverability and all other features you’d expect from a database.

## Optimized for performance

Peerbit is performant, so performant in fact you can use it for [streaming video](https://stream.dao.xyz) by having peers subscribing to database updates. In a low latency setting, you can achieve around 1000 replications a second and have a thoughput of 100 MB/s.
